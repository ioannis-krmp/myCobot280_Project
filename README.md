# myCobot280_Project
MyCobot280 Jetson nano Control System 

This repository contains a Python application for controlling the MyCobot280 robotic arm using a user-friendly graphical interface.
The application allows users to teach the robot specific paths by recording Cartesian coordinates and saving them for future playback.
Users can choose between different movement modes, including joint and linear movements, to explore the differences in trajectories.

Features:

* Record and save robot arm poses
* Playback saved poses with selected movement modes
* User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
* Future enhancements may include inverse kinematics capabilities to allow direct Cartesian control.
